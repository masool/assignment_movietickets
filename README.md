a simple Movie ticket smart contract. Make assumptions on attributes for the various objects

·         Four (4) ticketing windows sell movie tickets at a theatre

·         People can buy one or more tickets

·         Once 100 tickets are sold for a movie, that movie-show  is full

·         The theatre runs 5 movies at any time, and each show 4 times a day

·         Once a ticket is purchased a buyer automatically gets a bottle of water and popcorn on Window-1

·         At the end of the purchase, a ticket and receipt  is printed and the purchase is recorded on the blockchain

·         The buyer can go and exchange the water for soda at the cafeteria. Window 1 must generate a random number. If that number is even, the buyer must be able to get the water exchanged for soda at the cafeteria. The cafeteria has only 200 sodas, so only the first 200 requesters can exchange.
